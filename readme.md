### Books

- _Visualisation Analysis and Desgin_, de Tamara Munzner (2014)
    A universal and thorough nomenclature of graphs. Tamara Munzner makes a special effort to use precise wording, in order to reconciliate statisicians, graphic designers, computer scientists and cognitive psychologists.
- _Data Visualization, A practical introduction_, de Kieran Healy (2018)
    A gentle introduction to the world of graphs, but less comprehensive than the latter. [Available on line.](http://socviz.co).
- _The Grammar of Graphics_, de Leland Wilkinson (2005)
    The book which inspired the `ggplot2` library.

### Getting help with programming

- Stackoverflow, the number-1 site for getting help with programmation. Make sure you browsed extensively for your answer before asking a new question: you can fiter results with the `[keyword]` syntax. If you ask a question, try to be as generic as possible, so that it can be useful to others, and provide an easily reproducible exemple, so that potential helpers can focus on your particular problem.
- About `ggplot2`, I highly recommend `tidyverse`'s website ([link](https://www.tidyverse.org)), where you can find introductions to `ggplot2`, `dplyr` and `tidyr`, that I use extensively in the tutorials. R Studio, the company developping the `tidyverse` suite also provides [usefull cheat-sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets), and specifically ones [for `ggplot2`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf), [`dplyr`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) and [`tidyr`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf). The STHDA website ([link](http://www.sthda.com/french/wiki/ggplot2)) has readily available solutions to usual customisation problems.
